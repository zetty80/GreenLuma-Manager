## Code Style

- Follow C# naming conventions (PascalCase for public members, camelCase for private)
- Use `async`/`await` for asynchronous operations
- Implement `INotifyPropertyChanged` for data-bound properties
- Keep methods focused and single-purpose
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Add XML documentation comments for public APIs

## WPF Best Practices

- Use MVVM patterns where appropriate
- Leverage data binding over code-behind manipulation
- Use `SynchronizationContext` for UI thread marshaling
- Implement proper resource cleanup in `Dispose` methods
- Use value converters for data transformation in bindings
